# Catalog Website
Made a catalog website that functions like a simplified e-commerce site. Provides functionality for account creation, product viewership, and personal carts. Employed 
serialization and deserialization techniques to persist user data and shopping carts, providing data retention even when the Tomcat server is restarted. Also provided 
functionality to recover forgotten passwords.
